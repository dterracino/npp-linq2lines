npp linq2lines 
==============

Notepad++ plugin to query and manipulate text lines using .NET Linq.
For me as a .NET developer it's easier to think in LINQ. I've created this plugin to use the power of LINQ to query and manipulate text files on Notepad++.
The project is in very early stages. Since I don't have much time to work on it, I've decide to open source it on github with the hope that someone will find it useful and continue to contribute it.

Solution was created with Visual Studio 2010.
The plugin is based on NppPlugin.NET.v0.6 by UFO.

Enjoy,

p.s. this is my first github project... ;-)
